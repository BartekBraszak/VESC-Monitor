# VESC-Monitor
VESC UART/CAN monitor for telemetry data and BMS data. Only for private usage non commercial usage.

This is simple code for receiving and sending data over UART to communicate with devices connected to VESC via CAN.

Library used in this project is little bit remixed from @SolidGeek's library.
